專注於演算美學與表演藝術之深度對話，共有「[偽編舞]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2021-09-24-pseudo-choreography %})」、「[仿山水]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2021-09-24-imitation-shanshui %})」、「[人工美]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2021-09-24-artificial-beauty %})」三大主軸。

The Computing Aesthetics Lab engages in interdisciplinary studies between algorithmic aesthetics and performing arts. The “pseudo-choreography” project, simulated by fluid and flocking simulation, focuses on digital performance that integrates dance, computer graphics, animation and interactive technologies. The “imitations of Shan-Shui” project, inspired by Oriental aesthetics such as Chinese painting and Nihonga painting, focuses on oceanscape, cloudscape and landscape simulation based on atmospheric and volumetric rendering. “The Artificial Beauty and Sublime” project aims to create micro and immersive serenity with help of AI technologies such as generative adversarial networks.
