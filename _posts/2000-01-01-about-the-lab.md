專注於演算美學與表演藝術之深度對話，「偽編舞」系列關注於舞蹈、動畫特效、演算模擬之跨域展演，主要是以流體力學、群體行為、圖靈形態演化、細胞自動機等複雜系統進行動態模擬。「仿山水」系列，則以程序化生成代替古代筆墨寫生，關注以東方美學及日本美學為底蘊之山、海、雲景模擬，主要是以柏林噪聲、碎形布朗運動、次表面散射、容體渲染等進行光線追蹤演算。「人工美」仿生系列，以生命、生態系統為師，師法自然探究人造之崇高與美，現階段應用AI生成對抗網路。

The Computing Aesthetics Lab engages in interdisciplinary studies between algorithmic aesthetics and performing arts. The “pseudo-choreography” project, simulated by fluid and flocking simulation, focuses on digital performance that integrates dance, computer graphics, animation and interactive technologies. The “imitations of Shan-Shui” project, inspired by Oriental aesthetics such as Chinese painting and Nihonga painting, focuses on oceanscape, cloudscape and landscape simulation based on atmospheric and volumetric rendering. “The Artificial Beauty and Sublime” project aims to create micro and immersive serenity with help of AI technologies such as generative adversarial networks.
